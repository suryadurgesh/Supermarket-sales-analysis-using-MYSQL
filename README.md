# Supermarket Sales Analysis using SQL

This repository contains SQL queries and scripts for exploring and analyzing the **Supermarket Sales Dataset**. The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunjangir245/super-market-sales?resource=download) and provides detailed sales transactions from a supermarket, including product lines, payment methods, customer ratings, and more.

## Dataset Description

The **Supermarket Sales Dataset** contains transactional data from three branches of a supermarket over a period of 3 months. It includes information such as:
- Invoice ID
- Branch
- City
- Customer Type (e.g., Member, Normal)
- Gender
- Product Line
- Payment Method (e.g., Cash, Ewallet, Credit card)
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Gross Income
- Customer Ratings

The dataset is ideal for analyzing sales trends, identifying the most profitable branches, and understanding customer behaviors such as payment preferences and product line popularity.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle via [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunjangir245/super-market-sales?resource=download).

## SQL Queries Overview

This project uses SQL queries to perform various data analysis tasks, including:

1. **Basic Data Exploration**: Displaying the first, last, and random rows from the dataset.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating count, min, max, average, and standard deviation for key columns.
3. **Data Insights**: Finding missing values, most frequently used payment methods, and most profitable branches.
4. **Time-based Analysis**: Analyzing daily and monthly sales, finding the time of highest sales, and identifying trends based on customer ratings and gross income.
5. **Product and Customer Analysis**: Identifying the most purchased product line and determining which gender spends more on average.

## Sample SQL Queries

```sql
-- Display the first 5 rows from the dataset.
SELECT * FROM supermarket LIMIT 5;

-- Find the number of occurrences of each city.
SELECT City, COUNT(City) FROM supermarket GROUP BY City;

-- Find the most profitable branch as per gross income.
SELECT Branch, ROUND(SUM(`gross income`), 2) AS sum_gross_income 
FROM supermarket GROUP BY Branch ORDER BY sum_gross_income DESC;

-- Display the daily sales by day of the week.
SELECT dayname(Date) AS DayOfWeek, SUM(Total) AS TotalSales 
FROM supermarket 
GROUP BY DayOfWeek 
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;

-- Find the product line purchased in the highest quantity.
SELECT `Product line`, SUM(Quantity) FROM supermarket
GROUP BY `Product line` 
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC;
```
